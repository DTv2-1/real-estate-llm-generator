7 Latin American festivals to plan a trip around
While travelers around the world may be familiar with Rio's Carnival and Mexico's Dia de los Muertos celebrations, there are plenty more festivals worth traveling for across Latin America. The lineup is robust—from a breathtaking Guatemalan kite festival to the ultimate polar-bear plunge in the freezing waters off the Falkland Islands. Each one of the below celebrations offers unique moments of joy and a special opportunity to dig into cultural experiences with local communities. Here, a few of my favorites, plus what to do once the festivities wrap up.

Good restaurant although limited menu
Dec 2025 • Friends
A nice restaurant located in a very nice area, Barrio Escalante. The service is excellent, the atmosphere very pleasant with separate rooms. The food is pretty good, although the portions are not great. There is no great variety of dishes less drinks, something that affects a better selection of what you want to eat or drink.

Every CR Colon worth, loved it.
Dec 2025 • Business
Reservation is exzellent, rememberance email inclusive. Book early, because they are fuĺl.
The restaurant itself is in a house with the original rooms, so no more than 4-5 tables in a room.
The service is excellent, our waiter was Louis. The menue cards were in spanish and english via free WiFi.
Wait for the delicious and nicely decorated dishes. Absolutely fantastic. From fish to meat to vegetarian. Good drinks both non+/ alcoholic.
Enjoy your stay.

Nice place, very good food and excellent service.
Nov 2025 • Friends
Very nice place, good atmosphere, lack of some ambient music. The dishes of high gastronomy, good taste although the small portion size. Recipes and dishes not seen elsewhere. The staff was very helpful. In desserts for example very few options (only 2) and in drinks some basics are missing such as a simple cold tea that they do not offer.

Amana never misses: spectacular food and service
Aug 2025 • Couples
Nothing beats an Amana dinner! 😉 

We’ve always had a 5/5 experience in every category: food, service, vibes, drinks, and décor, and our latest visit was no exception. From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed, as if entering a friend’s home. The warm lighting instantly set the mood, encouraging us to relax, smile, take a seat, and enjoy the flawless service and food.

We started with the aji & goldenberry tiradito. Since we love goldenberries, this was a real treat—the combination of aji, the citrusy goldenberry, and the freshness of the fish made for a spectacular starter.

The grilled chicken was delicious, with a great mix of textures and flavors that we really enjoyed. The crispy pork belly was an unexpected highlight—perfectly balanced, with every bite offering a wonderful experience.

The drinks were spot on. Our favorite is the cas gimlet, so refreshing!

To wrap it up, something I’ve noticed about every Amana dish is that the ingredients are never combined just for show. Each pairing feels intentional and results in something truly delicious, which isn’t always the case with other culinary concepts. We absolutely love it here. Amana is hands down our favorite restaurant!
